# Weather-App
Vanilla JS Weather App

This project features a Weather app. The user can input the name of the desired place and the weather there is shown.

This API is used: https://api.openweathermap.org/ . You will need to change the value of the const 'key' to your own key in the script.js file line 4.

This is my version of a project you can find here https://www.100jsprojects.com/
